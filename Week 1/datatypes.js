//Create datatypes.js file and use the JavaScript typeof operator to check different data types. Check the data type of each variable
console.log(typeof 'Awelewa')
console.log(typeof 23)
console.log(typeof isMarried)
console.log(typeof false)
console.log(typeof null)
// i dont know if that console.log(typeof null) is actually correct i was only looking for a typeof for a null datatype
